# Sign-Language-Translator


The goal of the project is to show how easily we can translate hand signs made by the mute into text with the use of Mediapipe Hands. This would reduce the communication gap among the people and help them in socializing. This project uses Mediapipe Hands framework to process the hand signs and extract coordinates of 21 key points on the hand.
The Dataset was collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/american-sign-language-dataset. 

Currently this project can only convert hand signs into 26 English alphabets. 

Below the organization of the files are explained


# Files
